Problem Statement:
	1. We have to write program which will able to generate javascript file and html page.
	2. Input to that program is through file. That file contains rows,columns and DB socket with view.
	3. First show all the tables from database that are available to user.
	4. Then from those tables, user should be able to choose any one table for selection.
	5. Selected table should be shown in below text-field.
	6. by clicking on submit button, user will be redirected to new page where previously selected table is shown.
	7. On the redirected page, columns of table, its type and selection box will be shown to user.
	8. User will able to multiselect the columns of selected table and can toggle its selection.
	9. All the selected columns will be shown to user in text fields.
	10. After submitting the selection those text-filds will be taken as input to generate a table from it.
	11. That table will be shown to user and it will able to edit/insert/delete entries to column.
	12. Make UI user-friendly and Minimization of key-stroke as much as you can.
	13. Keys:
			[ Shift + TAB ] --- Change focus to left column
			[TAB] --- Change focus to right column
			[UP arrow ] --- change focus to upper row
			[DOWN arrow] --- Change focus to below row
			[F3] --- select/deselect all selection
